# Chess Game Implementation Plan

This document details a complete plan for building a chess game in Python. The design is modular and clear enough that another large language model (LLM) can follow it to implement a working game.

## Overview

The goal is to create a fully functional chess game in Python. The game will support:
- Standard chess rules, including piece movements and special moves (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
- Game state validation (check, checkmate, stalemate)
- A command-line interface (CLI) for human players (with possible future support for a graphical interface)
- A modular design to facilitate testing, maintenance, and potential future extensions (e.g., AI opponent)

---

## Requirements

- **Python Version:** 3.7+
- **Libraries:**
  - Standard libraries: `sys`, `copy`, `re` (for input parsing, if needed)
  - Optional: `unittest` for testing
- **Development Tools:** Any text editor or IDE

---

## Architecture and Modules

The game will be structured into the following modules/files:

1. **`main.py`**  
   - Entry point for the application.
   - Initializes game state and starts the game loop.

2. **`board.py`**  
   - Contains the `Board` class which manages the 8x8 grid and piece placements.
   - Responsible for setting up the board and handling moves on the board.

3. **`pieces.py`**  
   - Defines the base `Piece` class and subclasses for each chess piece (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).
   - Each class will implement its movement logic.

4. **`game.py`**  
   - Implements the `Game` class, which manages overall game flow:
     - Turn management
     - Move validation
     - Special move handling
     - Game termination conditions (checkmate, stalemate, draw)
   - Keeps a move history for rule enforcement (e.g., threefold repetition).

5. **`ui.py`**  
   - Implements the user interface (initially CLI-based).
   - Displays the board, prompts for user input (e.g., using algebraic notation or coordinate-based moves like `e2e4`), and shows error messages.

6. **`tests/`**  
   - A directory containing unit tests for key components:
     - Piece movement
     - Board state management
     - Game logic (check, checkmate, special moves)
   - Uses Python’s `unittest` module.

## Data Structures and Class Design

### Board Representation
- **Structure:** Use an 8x8 two-dimensional list (`list[list[Optional[Piece]]]`), where each element is either `None` or an instance of a `Piece`.
- **Coordinates:** Standard chess notation mapping (e.g., board[0][0] represents `a8` if using 0-indexed from the top).

### Piece Classes
- **Base Class:** `Piece`
  - **Attributes:** `color` (e.g., "white" or "black"), `position` (tuple or algebraic notation), `has_moved` (bool for special moves like castling and en passant)
  - **Methods:** 
    - `get_possible_moves(board: Board) -> List[Move]`: Returns legal moves for the piece based solely on movement rules.
  
- **Subclasses:** `Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Queen`, `King`
  - Override `get_possible_moves` with specific movement rules.
  - Include special logic for:
    - **Pawn:** Double move on first move, en passant, promotion.
    - **King:** Castling (check that the king does not pass through check).

### Supporting Classes
- **Move Class:**
  - Encapsulates a move with attributes such as `start_pos`, `end_pos`, and optionally `promotion_choice` for pawn promotion.
- **GameState:**
  - Could be a class or a structure within `Game` that tracks:
    - Current board state
    - Move history
    - Which player’s turn it is

## Game Mechanics and Rules

### Move Validation
- **Legal Move Check:** When a move is attempted, the following validations must occur:
  1. **Piece-Specific Rules:** The selected piece can move in the desired pattern.
  2. **Collision Detection:** No jumping over pieces (except Knight).
  3. **King Safety:** Ensure the move does not put or leave the player’s own king in check.
  4. **Special Moves:**
     - **Castling:** Verify that neither the king nor rook has moved, no pieces between them, and the king is not in check, does not pass through check, and does not end in check.
     - **En Passant:** Validate based on the last move.
     - **Pawn Promotion:** Check if a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board and then allow promotion to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight.

### Game Flow
- **Initialization:**  
  - Set up a new board with pieces in their standard starting positions.
- **Turn Loop:**
  1. Display the board.
  2. Prompt the current player for a move.
  3. Parse and validate the move.
  4. Execute the move and update the board.
  5. Check for end-game conditions:
     - Checkmate
     - Stalemate
     - Draw (e.g., insufficient material, threefold repetition, fifty-move rule)
  6. Switch turn.
- **Termination:**  
  - Declare the result (win, loss, draw) and optionally offer a rematch.

## User Interface

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- **Board Display:**  
  - Use ASCII art or Unicode characters to render the board.
  - Example: Display ranks and files (e.g., `a8` to `h1`).

- **Input Format:**  
  - Accept simple coordinate-based moves such as `e2e4` or standard algebraic notation if desired.
  - Validate the format before processing the move.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Provide clear messages for invalid moves or input errors.
  - Allow the user to re-enter their move.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Piece Movement Tests:**  
  - Verify that each piece’s `get_possible_moves` returns the correct moves given a board state.
- **Board Tests:**  
  - Test board initialization, piece placement, and move execution.
- **Game Logic Tests:**  
  - Validate move legality including checks for check, checkmate, and stalemate.
  - Special moves: Ensure castling, en passant, and pawn promotion work as expected.

### Integration Tests
- Simulate full games with scripted move sequences to verify the overall game flow and end-game detection.

---

## Optional Extensions

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
   - Use libraries such as `pygame` or `tkinter` to build a visual interface.
2. **AI Opponent:**  
   - Implement a basic AI using minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
   - Provide options for human vs. computer and computer vs. computer games.
3. **Advanced Game Rules:**  
   - Implement additional draw rules (threefold repetition, fifty-move rule).
   - Record game history in PGN (Portable Game Notation) format.

---

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Mechanics**
   - Implement `Piece` classes and the `Board` class.
   - Set up the initial board and test piece placements.
   - Develop the basic move generation for each piece.
   
2. **Phase 2: Game Flow**
   - Create the `Game` class to manage turns and enforce game rules.
   - Implement move validation (including special moves).
   - Develop the CLI in `ui.py` and integrate with game logic.
   
3. **Phase 3: Testing and Refinement**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Debug and refine move logic and game rules.
   
4. **Phase 4: Extensions (Optional)**
   - Add a GUI interface.
   - Develop an AI opponent.
   - Implement advanced draw and logging features.

## Confidence Level

I am confident (≈95%) that the outlined plan covers all essential aspects needed to implement a fully functional Python chess game. Specific areas like advanced draw rules and AI enhancements are marked as optional and can be iteratively developed after the core game is functional.
