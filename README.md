# Chess Web App

This is a rapid prototype of a full-featured chess game running in the browser. The app features a simple GUI, move history panel, and a minimal chess engine for move validation.

## Features

- 8×8 chessboard with alternating colored squares.
- Click‑to‑select then click‑to‑move user interface.
- Basic game state management and move history.
- Minimal chess engine (initial board state and simple move handling).
- Optional AI integration module (currently a stub returning random moves).
